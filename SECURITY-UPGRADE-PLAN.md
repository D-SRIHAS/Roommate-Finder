# Security Upgrade Plan for Roommate-Finder

## Current Security Vulnerabilities

GitHub has identified two major vulnerabilities in our dependencies:

1. **Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check** (High Severity)
   - Detected in nth-check (npm)
   - Located in: frontend/package-lock.json

2. **PostCSS line return parsing error** (Moderate Severity)
   - Detected in postcss (npm)
   - Located in: frontend/package-lock.json

## Resolution Plan

### Immediate Actions Taken
- Updated `node-notifier` to latest version
- Updated `tough-cookie` to latest version
- Added improved `.gitignore` file

### Next Steps (Breaking Changes)

To fully resolve all security vulnerabilities, we need to upgrade `react-scripts` to version 5.0.1, which will introduce breaking changes. This upgrade will fix:

- `nth-check` vulnerability 
- `postcss` vulnerability
- Multiple other dependencies with security issues

### Upgrade Process

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b security-upgrade
   ```

2. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install react-scripts@5.0.1 --save
   npm audit fix --force
   ```

3. **Test Application**
   - Start frontend locally
   - Test all major functionality
   - Fix any breaking changes

4. **Update React Version**
   - Our current React version (v19.0.0) is newer than what react-scripts@5.0.1 expects
   - We may need to pin React to version 18.x for compatibility

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Once everything is working, create a PR to merge the security fixes

## Timeline
- Security branch creation: Next development cycle
- Testing and fixes: 1-2 days
- Deployment: After successful testing

## Risk Assessment
- Risk of breaking changes is high
- Recommended to perform upgrade in a non-production environment first
- Create complete backups before proceeding
